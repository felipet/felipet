## ¬°Hola! üëã

I am a computer scientist who loves hardware and soldering!  I have been working with FPGAs for many years. My main contributions have been to the [White Rabbit project](https://white-rabbit.web.cern.ch/) and the [European Spallation Source](https://ess.eu/about). 

Despite my love of hardware, I am trying to steer my career towards software development, especially using the Rust programming language.

Find more information about me at my [personal web site](https://felipe.nubecita.eu/). Also, have a look at my [blog](https://felipe.nubecita.eu/posts/) in which I write about my current projects and interests.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Open Source Projects

- I started a project to deploy and test ¬µTCA equipment, which is still in use in the ESS: [ess-gendev-tools](https://github.com/felipet/ess-gendev-tools).
- I developed a fork of the OpenEVR HDL core for the ESS, which was meant to be integrated in a custom made board based on a picoZED board: [ess-openevr](https://github.com/felipet/ess-openevr).
- I contributed to several libs for testing White Rabbit devices: [py7slib](https://github.com/felipet/py7slib), [measuring_instr](https://github.com/felipet/measuring_instr), [calibration](https://github.com/felipet/wrcalibration).
- I stared a project to develop a collaborative database for cocktail recipes: [La Coctelera](https://felipe.nubecita.eu/projects/lacoctelera/).
- I develop a Telegram Bot to help investors keeping track of short positions against companies listed in the IBEX 35: [ShortBot](https://felipe.nubecita.eu/projects/shortbot/).
- A few crates at [crates.io](crates.io): [mailjet_client](https://crates.io/crates/mailjet_client), [finance_api](https://crates.io/crates/finance_api), [finance_ibex](https://crates.io/crates/finance_ibex) and [data_harvest](https://crates.io/crates/data_harvest).

### üíª I am currently working on ...

I spent most of my time developing _La Coctelera_ and _ShortBot_. I am willing to become an expert Rust developer, and those projects are an example of it.

### My skills

My top skills are:
- Digital hardware design, especially with FPGAs from AMD/Xilinx (VHDL).
- Hardware debug & testing (Python/C/C++).
- Baremetal software development for embedded devices (C/Python).
- Code optimisation (C/C++/Assembly).
- Design and implementation of APIs (Rust).
- Automatisation of CI flows for digital hardware design.
- Relational DB design (SQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, QuestDB).
